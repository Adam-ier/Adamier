            <p>In the manhwa he is known to be playboy who likes older ladies. He doesn't care about rank or status, and is only concerned with defeating Demigod. Although he is friendly towards allies and will offer them advice on improving their magic.â†µIn the novel, Lukas takes on a more calm and serious personality. He is not someone who would let his emotions get the best of him (unless if it is matters regarding demigods or his friends from 4000 years ago). He would always analyze the situation quietly before deciding what actions to take.</p>
